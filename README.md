# pilot-hdc-platform-gitops
GitOps repository that contains all the related configuration to manage the Pilot-HDC kubernetes clusters

## Vault Bootstrap (One-Time)

After ArgoCD deploys Vault, these manual steps are required once per cluster.

### Initialize & Unseal

```bash
# Initialize - outputs 5 unseal keys + root token
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -n vault -- vault operator init

# Store keys securely (dev cluster uses gopass), e.g:
# gopass ebrains-dev/hdc/ovh/vault-unseal-keys

# Unseal (repeat 3x with different keys)
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -n vault -- vault operator unseal
```

### Configure K8s Auth for External Secrets Operator

```bash
# Port-forward to Vault
kubectl port-forward -n vault svc/vault 8200:8200 &
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
vault login  # paste root token

# Enable K8s auth
vault auth enable kubernetes

# Configure K8s auth endpoint
vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
  kubernetes_host="https://kubernetes.default.svc"

# Enable KV v2 secrets engine
vault secrets enable -path=secret kv-v2

# Create read-only policy for ESO
vault policy write external-secrets - <<EOF
path "secret/data/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "secret/metadata/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
EOF

# Create role bound to ESO service account
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/external-secrets \
  bound_service_account_names=external-secrets \
  bound_service_account_namespaces=external-secrets \
  policies=external-secrets \
  ttl=1h
```

### Verify Integration

```bash
# Create test secret
vault kv put secret/test foo=bar

# Check ESO synced it (ClusterSecretStore "vault" is pre-configured)
kubectl get externalsecret -A
```
